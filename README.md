# LaTeX assignment template for the University of Regina (Unofficial)

This is an unofficial LaTeX (pronounced either "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech") assignment template for the students of the [University of Regina](https://www.uregina.ca) (U of R).

[Demo](https://uploads.ayonkhan.me/file/baquet/uofr-assignment-template/demo.pdf)

**>> Please consult with your teacher or supervisor before using the template. <<**

## How to Use

You can install a LaTeX distribution such as [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/), [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) on your computer, and then import the files.

However, I would suggest an online editor like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or [Papeeria](http://papeeria.com/) if you are new to LaTeX. You should also check out these books.
